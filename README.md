# CSIC-5011-Miniproject
A distance function for ordinal regression dimensional reduction (CSIC 5011 Mini project)

**MDS** is implemented using Matlab **mdscale** function https://ww2.mathworks.cn/help/stats/mdscale.html.

**Isomap** is implemented using **Toolbox Graph** in Matlab, which can be download in https://ww2.mathworks.cn/matlabcentral/fileexchange/5355-toolbox-graph.

**t-SNE** is from http://lvdmaaten.github.io/tsne/.

Auto color generater comes from function **linspecer** https://github.com/davidkun/linspecer

**Parallel pool** in Matlab is needed for distance calculation.

The figures in report can be generated by runing **hand_written_MDS.m**, **hand_written_isomap.m** and **hand_written_t_SNE.m**.

The classes that include in dimension reduction can be selected by setting value of **min_num** and **max_num** in .m file.

Please install above component befor runing the .m file.
